# Running tests:

1. Make sure pytest is installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Use `py.test` to run the test suite (PyCharm has a run configuration for this also). Note: if you keep your virtualenv in your project directory, run `py.test tests` to run only OSF-Offline tests.

## Notes:

* If you want increased verbosity use `py.test -v`
* If you need to access the program's stdout (for ipdb, print statements, etc), use `py.test -s`
* To run a specific suite or test use: `py.test tests/<module>.py::<TestClassName>::(<test_name>)?`
