that needs to be taken, it sends that action

 - as you update the db, you can send a signal out to do
-


 - while comparing osf and db, you can update remote. you can also update db.
 - AS you check, you can make a queue of update_fs events. This will include upd
ating, renaming, moving, deleting.
 - Once the check_osf is done, you can THEN, do the update_fs events one by one
as they are in the queue.
 - Items in the queue will be fs_event items. fs_event items will have
 - Each fs_event will actually just be a watchdog.events type. It will basically tell you what the src_path and dest_path are. NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
 - Will have to make custom event type.
        - input will be db_model that requires the updating.
                - CREATE(new_model, remote_file_folder)
                        - if node/folder then create folder. if file then download file.
                - DELETE(model_that is being deleted, remote)
                - RENAME
                - MODIFIED
